            MAFS is in its 15th year of serving hot lunches to the senior citizen population. These lunches are nutritionally balanced but more importantly they provide an opportunity for seniors to make friends and socialize to break free from isolation. These meals are freshly prepared by trained cooks under strict hygienic conditions. We provided 33,905 hot meals to the community this year from our Chicago, Niles and Roselle facilities.
